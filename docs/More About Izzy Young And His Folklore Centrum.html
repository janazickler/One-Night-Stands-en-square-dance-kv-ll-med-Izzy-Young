               <h3>More About Izzy Young And His Folklore Center</h3>
               <p>Israel Goodman Young (1928-2019), widely known just as Izzy Young, was, and is still, considered one of the most important experts of folk music,<br> 
                  in the USA and in Sweden. In 1957 he opened The Folklore Center in Greenwich Village in New York, which was a type of music store with books, records<br> 
                  and magazines related to folk music. It was also a place where the concerts were held, and where folk and blues musicians from around the country would<br> 
                  come to gather and connect. There is a Bob Dylan’s song “Talkin’ Folklore Center” that describes Izzy’s store the best<br></p>
               <p>“…On MacDougal Street I saw a cubby hole, I went in to get out of the cold, Found out after I’d entered, The place was called the Folklore Center<br> 
                  —Owned by Izzy Young —He’s always in back —Or the center. They got real records and real books, Anybody can walk in and look. You don’t have to own<br> 
                  a Cadillac car, Or a nine hundred and fifty-two dollar guitar —Do like most people do —Walk in —Walk around —Walk out…”</p>         
               <p>Izzy Young would let the still unknown, Bob Dylan, sit in the back of the store, reading books and listening to the records. Later on, Izzy produced<br>
                   Dylan’s very first feature concert, in Carnegie Chapter Hall, NYC.</p>
               <p>Besides Dylan, many other folk musicians were Izzy’s friends, as well as performers in The Folklore Center. Among them were many important and widely<br>
                  known names such as Dave Van Ronk, Joni Mitchell and Tim Buckley, just to mention a few.</p>   
               <p>Izzy took a role in a political activism, as well. He was known as a leader of “the beatnik riot”, in 1961, where he led the march against the music<br> 
                  performance ban in Washington Square Park, Greenwich Village, NYC.</p>   
               <p>In the 1973, after he befriended two Swedish folk musicians and fell in love with Swedish folk music, Izzy closed his New York store and moved to<br> 
                  Stockholm, and opened the Folklore Centrum. The Folklore Centrum remained active till 2018. It had a unique collection of books, music records and CD’s,<br> 
                  as well as posters and photographs related to the history of folk music and folklore, as it also continued to be a place for meetings and concerts for<br> 
                  musicians and followers of the genre. The Folklore Centrum’s library, in its major part, is now hosted by the Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and<br> 
                  Izzy’s personal writings and journals are housed at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.</p>
